/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Demyanenko Team Hub.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and
 * associated athlete/parent data.  Only the authenticated user can read or
 * modify their own profile data. Athlete and Parent profiles are linked to
 * user profiles via the 'userId' field, and only the associated user can
 * create, update, or delete these profiles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, where userId is the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /athletes/{athleteId}: Stores athlete profiles, linked to user profiles via the 'userId' field.
 * - /parents/{parentId}: Stores parent profiles, linked to user profiles via the 'userId' field.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only manage their own profiles.
 * - Athlete and Parent profiles are only manageable by the linked user.
 * - Listing of users, athletes, and parents is restricted to prevent information leakage.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The 'Athlete' and 'Parent' documents contain the 'userId' field, which is a denormalized
 * copy of the user's UID. This allows security rules to validate ownership without
 * performing additional 'get()' operations.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * Athlete and Parent profiles are stored in separate top-level collections to simplify
 * access control based on user roles.
